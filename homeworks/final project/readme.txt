CSCI 4229 final project 

My project idea was to create a small city in OpenGl.

Control of the Program: 
    Z : zoom in 
    z : zoom out 
    f : switch to first person navication. You should be able to navigate the scene in this mode.
        Use 'a', 's', 'd', 'w' keys to navigate
    0 : reset settings

Misc controls :
    l/L : enable or disable lighting
    g/G : turn on or off fog effect
    i/I : use directional light (to simulate sunlight)
    q/Q : enable or disable debug objects (axes, print statements)
    u/U : decrease or increase diffuse light
    b/B : decrease or increase ambient light
    c/C : decrease or increase specular light

Reference
    - I've used following code as a template:
      https://github.com/jacobhaynes/CSCI4229/tree/master/Homework3_Scene
      I only used one very simple 3D rectangular object from this code (see drawGround function). Everything else in the program is my own work.
      Original code didn't have any textures. So, I modified the borrowed object to support texture mapping.
    - I also took ideas from the example codes shown in class.
