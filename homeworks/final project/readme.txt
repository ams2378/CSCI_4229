 Remaining work:
    I wanted to first layout the landscape and basic building blocks (like homes, buildings, trees etc) before I start 
    adding interesting features. I think I'm a little bit behind and I'll try to put extra effort to get rest of 
    the featues done by this week.

    I still have following remaining work:
        - Add textures to the scene-
            - I didn't add any texture in parking garage next to the forest. 
            - Top of the building. 
        - Create a cube and place the scene inside it. I'll add texture (i.e. sky/horizon) in the cube to make the scene look realistic. 
        - Lighting, shadows and animation.
